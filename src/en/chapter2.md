## CHAPTER 2. The Silence of Seoul

Whatever the situation in Washington or Tokyo, it cannot be said that Seoul, capital of South Korea, was caught completely unawares. On the contrary, the South Korean government, though also strangely silent in the days immediately preceding the outbreak of the war, had been expecting trouble. Early in May, President Syngman Rhee had made an appeal for combat planes saying, “May and June may be the crucial period in the life of our nation.” On May 10, Captain Sihn Sung Mo, Defense Minister of South Korea, had held a press conference at Seoul in which he stated “that North Korean troops were moving in force toward the 38th Parallel and that there was imminent danger of invasion from the North.” Robert T. Oliver, an American adviser of Rhee’s, had made an appeal for planes for South Korea in the June 9 issue of a publication called Periscope on Asia, warning that “unless the decision is ‘yes,’ and unless the planes are sent promptly, the next Soviet advance in Asia could be down the Korean peninsula.”

“Why did the South Koreans do badly at the beginning?” John Gunther asks in his book on MacArthur, a book which embodies the official version of Tokyo Headquarters. “They were taken by surprise, and were miserably short of arms.” The surprise is questionable and the inadequacy of their equipment was no secret. The day after the war started, the New York Herald Tribune correspondent at Tokyo filed a dispatch on the lack of equipment in the South Korean forces. Its transmission was inexplicably delayed and it was not published until four days later. “Only last month,” he reported, “Brigadier General William L. Roberts, then head of the American military mission to South Korea, urged American-supplied airpower for South Korea and spoke of danger if it should not be forthcoming.” General Roberts was not subject to MacArthur. No similar warning came out of Tokyo Headquarters.

It is true that on June 27, two days after fighting began, the United Nations Commission cabled the Security Council that the South Koreans “were taken completely by surprise as they had no reason to believe from intelligence sources that invasion was imminent.” In the light of information already in the possession of the Commission but not made public until almost three months later, this was untrue.

On September 14, the Commission made public a report which showed that on several occasions officials of the South Korean government had discussed with the Commission signs that the North was preparing for an invasion. The first occasion was in January, 1950, when the Chief of Staff of the South Korean army “informed the committee that he believed the aggressive plans of the North Korean authorities to be mature, and that it was only a matter of time before they would be put into action.” He supplied detailed intelligence figures, which are given in the report. The second occasion was a month later when the Chief of Staff “stated that the North Korean forces possessed more powerful and more numerous artillery weapons than did the Army of the Republic of Korea,” and gave figures on the increase in the number of tanks, armored cars, and planes on the Northern side. The next occasion was in May when “the attention of the commission” was drawn to a statement made by the South Korean Defense Minister at a press conference on May 10, at which he declared “that North Korean troops were moving in force toward the 38th Parallel and that there was imminent danger of invasion from the North.”

The Commission arranged for a meeting with the Foreign Minister “to ask for information on the seriousness of the danger and the degree of imminence of the invasion, as envisaged by the Defense Minister.” A private hearing was held by the Commission at which the Acting South Korean Deputy Chief of Staff and the chief of intelligence of the South Korean army gave “important and detailed information,” which indicated an extensive buildup of forces and equipment on the 38th Parallel.

After the hearing, members “informally heard” from two officers on the staff of General William L. Roberts, chief of the United States Military Advisory Group to the South Korean army. These officers “substantially confirmed the information given by the Korean military authorities” but “did not, however, agree on the imminence of any danger and again expressed confidence in the ability of the Army of the Republic to handle the forces of the Northern regime in case of attack.” The hearing was on May 12. The war broke out on June 25, less than six weeks later. It is difficult to reconcile this information made public on September 14 with the earlier statement in the UN Commission cable of June 27 that the South Koreans “had no reason to believe from intelligence sources that invasion was imminent.”

Another UN Commission document little noticed at the time also makes it hard to understand the Commission’s insistence that the attack was a complete surprise. This appears as Document No. 14 in the State Department’s White Paper on Korea. It was not transmitted to the United Nations Security Council until June 29 but it was dated June 24, the day before the fighting began. The heading is significant: “Following report dated 24 June from United Nations field observers submitted to Commission on their return from field trip along 38th Parallel commencing 9 June to report developments likely to involve military conflict is forwarded for information.”

In view of the warnings by South Korean authorities in May and the intelligence reports later furnished by Admiral Hillenkoetter in Washington, it would seem to have been a good precaution to send out field observers “to report developments likely to involve military conflict.” But again it is difficult to reconcile the sending out of observers for this purpose from June 9 to June 24 with the view that there was “no reason to believe from intelligence sources that invasion was imminent.”

It would be good to know more about these field observers, how they happened to be sent out, how they were picked out, and how they operated. The field report is signed “Szu-Tu,” apparently a Chinese. Next to the United States, Nationalist China was Syngman Rhee’s strongest supporter in the United Nations, and Chiang and Rhee worked closely together, notably in their joint campaign for a Pacific Pact to be supported by the United States. The field observers ended their tour and made their report on June 24. If they had waited a few more hours they might have seen how the fighting actually started, for the war broke out early on the morning after their return.

The field report seemed designed to show that the South Koreans could not have had any offensive purposes. “Principal impression left with observers after their field tour,” the report says, “is that South Korea Army is organized entirely for defense and is in no condition to carry out attack on large scale against forces of North.” The report states: “In general, attitude South Korean commanders is one of vigilant defense. Their instructions do not go beyond retirement in case of attack upon previously prepared positions.” It declares there was no evidence of reconnaissance northward “nor of any undue excitement or activity at divisional headquarters or regimental levels to suggest preparation for offensive activity.” The lack of South Korean air support, armor, and heavy artillery would make “any action with object of invasion … impossible.” The timing and the observations, on the very eve of the war’s outbreak, provided a remarkably convenient alibi for the South Koreans.

The field report ends with a statement which later helped to create the picture of a surprise attack from the North. It says that no intelligence reports had been received “of any unusual activity on the part of North Korean forces that would indicate any impending change in general situation along Parallel.” This would seem to be a debatable conclusion on the basis of the field report itself. It gives several intelligence indications which might reasonably have seemed danger signals. At several points North Koreans had taken possession of “salients on south side parallel, occupation in at least one case being of fairly recent date.” In some sectors “civilians had recently been removed from areas adjoining parallel to north to depths ranging from 4 to 8 kilometers.” On Thursday night, June 22, the regimental headquarters at Ongjin received intelligence reports “to effect that there was increased military activity … about four kilometers north parallel.” The reference to increased military activity near Ongjin is striking, for the very first cablegram from the American Ambassador at Seoul reporting the outbreak of fighting said: “Action was initiated about 4 A.M. Ongjin was blasted by North Korean artillery fire.”

When we add the information in the United Nations reports to that which emerged from the Hillenkoetter hearing and couple this with the public statements of the South Korean government itself, it is impossible to accept the flat statement by the UN Commission that the South Koreans had “no reason to believe from intelligence sources that invasion was imminent.” This statement, with no supporting evidence, was made in the Commission’s cable of June 27 to the Security Council, the very day sanctions were voted. But the facts here presented, from which the Commission supposedly drew its deductions, did not come to light until later. They underscore the wisdom of the Yugoslav delegate in urging that the Security Council act less hastily.

What puzzles one in the record of events is why the South Korean government made no effort after its Defense Minister’s press conference of May 10 to attract public attention to the danger it feared and the inadequate military equipment of which it had complained.

The silence is all the more striking because the South Korean government was confronted with a political problem more serious than the military problem. This was the question of how far the United States would support the South in war with the North. The question had been brought sharply to public attention by an interview which Senator Connally of Texas, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, had given the influential Washington weekly, U.S. News and World Report. As the Democratic Party’s foremost congressional spokesman on foreign policy, the veteran Senator from Texas spoke with authority. What he had to say attracted more attention in the Far East than at home. The English-language paper in Tokyo, the Nippon Times, gave it a front-page spread on May 3: “REDS WILL FORCE U.S. TO QUIT SOUTH KOREA, CONNALLY PREDICTS.”

In the interview, Senator Connally was asked whether the suggestion “that we abandon South Korea is going to be seriously considered.” The Senator replied that he was afraid that this was going to happen “whether we want it to or not.” He thought the Communists were going to overrun Korea when they got ready just as they “probably will overrun Formosa.”

When asked, “But isn’t Korea an essential part of the defense strategy?” he had replied: “No. Of course any position like that is of some strategic importance. But I don’t think it is very greatly important. It has been testified before us that Japan, Okinawa, and the Philippines make the chain of defense which is absolutely necessary.”

The next day there was an alarming response in Washington, where Secretary of State Dean Acheson “declined to say whether the United States might have to abandon South Korea to Russia,” and a cry of protest from Rhee in Seoul, where he called in the Associated Press for an exclusive interview in which he said, “Senator Connally must have forgotten that the United States has committed herself and cannot pull out of the Korea situation with honor.”

Senator Connally’s statement that Korea was not part of the essential American defense “perimeter” in the Far East reflected a strategic decision made months before and well known in Washington. It was this strategic decision not to defend South Korea which led Syngman Rhee’s former American adviser, Robert T. Oliver, to write later in his book, Why War Came in Korea, that one of the reasons for the Communist attack was that “American authoritative statements indicated that we would not defend Korea.”

If Rhee feared attack, it was important for him to try to change that decision. A campaign was indeed begun in the press to publicize Korea’s danger. A dispatch from Seoul in the Nippon Times, May 7, said: “The brave South Koreans would go north at a drop of a hat—Uncle Sam—but this appears unlikely. The question unanswered is, when will Russian-backed North Koreans come South?” The story went on to say that “this situation has brought Korea to the world’s attention. The UN has struggled with the problem. Statesmen have proclaimed Korea must not be deserted in the face of the Communist deluge of Asia and others have replied such a fate is a matter of time, so why prolong it at the expense of the American taxpayers”—presumably a reference to Senator Connally and the unfeeling Democrats. On May 10, the South Korean Defense Minister held the press conference at which he said North Korean troops were moving in force toward the 38th Parallel and there was imminent danger of invasion from the North. This was the last public appeal made by the South Korean Republic. Why the silence after that date?

There were no statements from Seoul. There were no inspired press dispatches from Tokyo. There were no speeches in Congress. Could it be that Rhee received advice that it would be wiser to invite or provoke attack, and then trust to the impact on American public opinion to change American policy? Rhee was apparently content to let that basic American strategic decision go unchallenged, to draw up his troops into defensive positions, to give them orders to withdraw in event of attack, and to arrange for United Nations observers to see how defensive all his military dispositions were. The observers brought in their reports on the 24th. That night, in their absence, the war began. Rhee announced that it began with an unprovoked invasion from the North. The North Korean government, on the contrary, reported that South Korean forces crossed the Parallel in three different places, were hurled back, and the North Korean forces then went over to the offensive.
